This is the initial take on what we need to build to make this possible.

# The Challenge #
Launch a rocket with basic solid state boosters and log data using a [Raspberry Pi Zero](https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/#raspberry-pi-zero). 

# What's the computer look like? #
Oh yeah, and keep in mind that every _gram_ of weight we add to the computer will require additional thrust. Every cubic centimeter that we add will also force us to make the rocket bigger so the housing for the computer will contain it.

## The Rocket Computer ##
What needs to go in the rocket?
* Raspberry Pi Zero
* A transmitter
* Sensors
* Storage?

### Transmitter ###
This is just to transmit status and data back to mission control. For the initial test flight, we don't need it to receive any messages from mission control. (Even if it could receive from mission control, it couldn't _do_ anything with those messages other than log them...)

### Sensors ###
The onboard sensors are probably the trickiest part.

### Storage ###

## Mission Control Computer ##
What needs to be in the mission control computer?
* Raspberry Pi Zero (obviously)
* Weather sensors (for launch decisioning)
* Display
*
