# The Challenge #
Launch a rocket with basic solid state boosters and log data using a (Raspberry Pi Zero)[https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/#raspberry-pi-zero]. 

This is the initial take on what we need to build to make this possible.

# What does the computer need? #

What needs to go in the rocket?
* Raspberry Pi Zero
* A transmitter
* Sensors

What needs to be in the mission control computer?

## Transmitter ##
This is just to transmit status and data back to mission control. For the initial test flight, we don't need it to receive any messages from mission control. (Even if it could receive from mission control, it couldn't _do_ anything with those messages other than log them...)

## Sensors ##
